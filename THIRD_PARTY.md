# Third-party code provenance

This file is the provenance register for any vendored or adapted third-party
source code included in this repository.

## Current status

The core library under the module root and `internal/` is original and
stdlib-only. The directory CLI adapts the Gitleaks path-exclusion list recorded
below, and the reference CLI and integrations use the pure-Go dependencies
also recorded below.

The `licence-check` CI job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforces this by
scanning for copyright headers that do not attribute Last Person Labs and by
failing the build if this file is missing.

`TestThirdPartyRegisterMatchesGoMod` (`thirdparty_test.go`) enforces the
other half: every module in `go.mod` — direct or indirect — must have an
entry below whose recorded release and pinned licence-file URL match the
required version. Bumping a dependency without updating its entry here is a
test failure, because a register pinned to a version the project no longer
ships cannot be re-audited.

## Recording a new entry

If a future change vendors or adapts code from another project (for example,
a small algorithm lifted from a reference implementation, or a generated
table derived from a third-party corpus), add an entry below **before**
merging, and record the copied code's licence header here, in this file (see
the Gitleaks entry below for the pattern), rather than embedding it in the
local source file itself: the `licence-check` CI job scans every file except
this one and `LICENSE` for non-"Last Person Labs" `Copyright` lines and fails
the build on a match, so a third-party header left in the local file would
break CI. Each entry must record:

- **Source URL** — the exact upstream repository/file URL the code was taken
  from.
- **Commit** — the upstream commit hash (or release tag) the code was copied
  at, so provenance can be re-verified later.
- **Licence** — the upstream licence identifier (e.g. `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`,
  `BSD-3-Clause`) and confirmation that it is compatible with this project's
  MIT licence.
- **Local path** — where the adapted/vendored code lives in this repository.

### Entry template

```
### <short name of the vendored component>

- Source URL:
- Commit:
- Licence:
- Local path:
- Notes: (what was changed from upstream, if anything)
```

Entries are append-only; do not remove a historical entry even if the code is
later deleted, unless the entire file is being reset to reflect a clean
audit (note the reset in the PR description).

## Adapted code

### Gitleaks default path exclusions

- Source URL: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/b58d3f102cf3a2c84cb7f923d05c25c9b1aed84b/cmd/generate/config/base/config.go
- Commit: `b58d3f102cf3a2c84cb7f923d05c25c9b1aed84b`
- Licence file: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/b58d3f102cf3a2c84cb7f923d05c25c9b1aed84b/LICENSE
- Licence: MIT; compatible with this project's MIT licence.
- Local path: `cmd/goredact/dir.go`
- Notes: The upstream default path regular expressions are used to prune
  dependency directories and skip generated, media, document, and binary files
  during recursive scans. Traversal and explicit-file behavior are original.
